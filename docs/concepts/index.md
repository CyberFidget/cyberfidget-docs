# Concepts

These guides explain the core concepts behind Cyber Fidget apps. Whether you're just curious or ready to dive into code, each page has something for you.

Each concept page is written in layers:

1. **What is this?** — A brief intro for beginners
2. **Concepts** — Deeper explanation with analogies for curious users
3. **Code examples** — Annotated snippets for tinkerers
4. **Framework details** — Implementation notes for hackers
