  "caption": "Gather: (1) Case front with color filter, buttons, slider, and lenses installed, (2) Screen Retainer, (3) Button Head Screws (2x, #2-56 x 5/32in), (4) Mainboard\n\n\n\n1 - Insert the screws into the screen retainer (5)\n\n\n\n2 - Carefully peel off the screen protector. Be mindful of its fragileness and fingerprints (6).\n\n\n\n3 - Place the Case Front down onto a surface and guide the screen into the pocket above the color filter. The edge of the case pocket (7) is cut to perfectly fit the screen outline (8) itself and align the pixels to the screen window. It's generally easiest to start with the edge closest to the buttons, then carefully push the ribbon and screen into the case by sliding the Mainboard down into the case vertically until the screen is flat to the screen pocket.\n\n⚠️ BE CAREFUL NOT TO CATCH THE CORNERS OF THE SCREEN. There is extra material cut out of the case to avoid this. Make sure the screen is inside the pocket and the corners of the screen are free from contact (9).\n\n\n4 - While holding the Mainboard vertically with your non-dominant hand, keep the screen from moving, grab the screen retainer (with screws pre-inserted) and set into its guide pockets (10), (11).\n\n⚠️ Make sure the screws ((10), (11)) and the screen retainer are seated flush. If they are not flush, the screws may contact and damage the Mainboard in the next step. Check by visually inspecting from the side for gaps and the tap test.\n\n\n\n5 - Using an allen key, tighten the screen retainer screws until fully seated then add 1/16 turn (max 1/8). The retainer is designed to act as a spring; additional torque does not improve retention and can introduce unnecessary stress that may lead to long-term deformation in the plastic (12). \n⚠️ Keep a close eye on the screen to make sure it has not lifted and/or shifted while tightening down. This will break the screen if it has and you continue to tighten the screen retainer.\n\n\n6 - Inspect to make the screen edge is aligned with the screen pocket (13). Using a similar method to the slider, lightly tap the back of the screen with your finger to see if it clicks/makes noise (13). The screen should not make any noise and be completely flat with the pocket.\n\nIf there is a clicking sound when tapping, first ensure there is no unintended part interference or debris, then tighten the retainer screws in small increments (~ 1/10th of a turn) until it stops clicking.\n\nIf the screen is not aligned to the pocket, loosen the retaining screws and shift the screen until it is aligned (using as little force as possible) and retighten the screws. \n\n\n(16) - Example of a poorly aligned screen resting on the buttons instead of the screen pocket. This causes the screen corner to incorrectly overlap the pocket in a way that will crack.\n\n(17) - Example of a well-aligned screen.\n\n(18) - Example of a well-aligned screen.\n\n\n7 - Adjust the slide potentiometer (14) and metal slider (15) to be in both bottom positions.\n\n\n\n8 - Lower the Mainboard into the case. It is important to keep the Mainboard as parallel to the case as possible when lowering it in (e.g. guide it in and avoid having it enter at its naturally steep angle). This will keep the flex ribbon and slider properly aligned when tightening. \n\nℹ️ It may be a snug fit depending on how cleanly you snapped the circuit board rails off.\n\n\n\n9 - While holding the Mainboard down to the Case Front with your forefingers, inspect the slider to ensure the metal fork of the slider is engaged with the plastic nub of the slide potentiometer. It will be very noticeable when it is properly engaged. Test the full range to make sure it does not pop out. \n\nℹ️ If the slider is not properly engaged, it's necessary to pull the Mainboard back up out of the case and readjust their positions (put the slider at the bottom and move the slide potentiometer near bottom if needed). \n\nℹ️ If the Mainboard is too snug to drop out with gravity, utilize a small plastic pry tool between the edge of board near the USB-C port and Front Case or very carefully prying one of the mounting holes on the Mainboard. It's important to not scratch the Mainboard with a metal tool or pry it excessively and crack the board. In the worst case, it is possible to push the board out with the buttons to try again. Be mindful of the board pulling on the screen flex cable once it is free.",
