# Assembly Guide



## Step 1 - Gather Parts, Tools, and Space

<p class="muted">Part of offering the Cyber Fidget as a kit is that it allows people to get to know what they've bought a little better and instill that sense of ownership. With that said, the kit may not be for everyone, but if you're reading this guide, let's assume you've got some interest!</p>

<p class="muted">It's important to address a couple house keeping topics on assembling your Cyber Fidget. It has tiny parts that love to roll away or be tricky to see while assembling. While a lot of effort has been taken to make it as enjoyable as possible (e.g. the creation of this guide), it is important that you uphold your part of the deal of signing up for assembling a kit. This means have a clean, well lit, non-scratching, flat surface. A piece of printer paper is a great surface. Also avoid static when handling the main board - don't pokes the main board with your fingies after skipping around on your carpet in socks in a dry environment.</p>

<p class="muted">Set aside some time. Recognize that most pieces are supposed to fit together smoothly, with minimal force. A motto to keep is if it feels weird, it's probably wrong - so double check the guide or contact us if you're unsure.</p>

<p class="muted">While it's very appreciated you're excited about assembling the kit, please don't try to assembly it in your car or at a restaurant table. Please don't try to rush assembly. Trust us, it's a lot more enjoyable to dedicate some time and space and consider the assembly a unique, one-time experience as a part of the ownership. Unintentionally losing or breaking a piece is no way to have fun. But stuff happens, so please reach out if something doesn't go right!</p>

## Step 2 - Case Front Lenses

<p class="muted">Gather: Case Front (1), Front Lenses (2, Longer of the set)</p>

<p class="muted">1 - Carefully align the lens to the lens bore (3). It is a precise slip fit to avoid having to use glue during assembly. <br>2 - Use fingers or tweezers to get the lens started, then firmly, but carefully press the lens until it bottoms out (4). You may use a soft blunt object like the backside of a pencil to aid pushing it in.<br>2 - Repeat for the second lens (5)</p>

<p class="muted">⚠️ If you attempt to push the lens in crooked, it will create a burr on the side of the acrylic lens and make it more difficult to push in. Take care not to jam the lens into the bore without getting it aligned first. It shouldn't affect the optical properties if a tiny burr occurs, but it will be more difficult to assemble.</p>

</div>


## Step 3 - Slider

<p class="muted">Gather: (1) Case Front, (2) Slider, (3) Philips Head (1x, #2-56 x 5/32in)</p>

<p class="muted">1 - Insert the slider into the front of the case, with the fork at the bottom side of the case (4) and the threaded hole towards the top (5). Make sure it feely moves.<br>2 - Using a small Philips Head Screwdriver, insert the screw into the slider and tighten until snug and the slider is still free to move (6). <br>3 - Test for excessive rattling by tapping the front face of the slider with your index finger while slowly tightening (7).</p>

<p class="muted">ℹ️ After the screw is mostly in, you will only be doing very small turns as the screw bottoms into the threads intentionally. The screw is meant to be snug to avoid backing out without threadlocking compound.<br>ℹ️ The rattling will not completely go away with this test unless the slider is too tight. In normal use, this rattling does not exist due to how constrained the slider is in the pocket.</p>

</div>


## Step 4 - Install Buttons

<p class="muted">Gather: (1) Case Front, (2) Buttons, (3) Reference Layout</p>

<p class="muted">1 - Using the Reference Layout (unless you want to reprogram the button layout), insert the buttons into the Case Front. The buttons and case have a reasonably close fit to reduce rattling, and will require0 inserting them perpendicularly (4). There should be very little, if at all, force involved.</p>

<p class="muted">ℹ️ (5) You can you use your fingers to hold the buttons in while you flip the case over to see if it matches the layout you want.<br>ℹ️ (6) For extra fun after assembly, you can fill the grooves with your choice of paint to add extra contrast. Acrylic paint pens work reasonably well and are very affordable.</p>

</div>


## Step 5 - Install Color Filter

<p class="muted">Gather: (1) Case Front, (2) Color Filter</p>

<p class="muted">1 - Grab tweezers or wash your hands<br>2 - Carefully holding the Color Filter to avoid fingerprints (3), remove the protective film (4).<br>3 - Remove the film from the other side of the filter (5)<br>4 - Insert the filter into the Case Front pocket over the screen window (6)</p>

<p class="muted">ℹ️ Don't forget to remove the film from both sides of the color filter or nearly the entire Cyber Fidget will have to be disassembled.</p>

</div>


## Step 6 - Prepare Mainboard

<p class="muted">Gather: (1) Mainboard</p>

<p class="muted">ℹ️ If your mainboard arrives with extra support material, it is necessary to snap it off. As one final part of the manufacturing process, the circuit board has a groove cut into it to make removing the extra material easy.</p>

<p class="muted">⚠️ Be careful of the OLED screen and it's ribbon cable. The screen itself is fragile glass that it easily chipped and the flex cable is easily torn.<br>1 - Hold the mainboard in your non-dominant hand, grasping it confidently between your thumb and index finger (1).</p>

<p class="muted">Your thumb will be able to sit on the flat part of the board with the logo and your index finger on top of the buttons.</p>

<p class="muted">The screen should be on the same side as you (2)<br>2 - Grab a rail opposite of your hand and slowly bend the board away from you (3). It's okay to wiggle back and forth and eventually snap it off (4).<br>3 - Rotate the board 180 degrees and snap the opposite side off the same way, again being mindful not to snag the screen or rub on components (5). Snap it off (6).<br>4 - Then repeat the same for the piece near the USB-C connector (7).<br>5 - Then repeat for the piece remaining under the screen. The cable can be flex away as shown and be sure not to catch or interfere with it more than is necessary. It should snap away from the screen (9)</p>

<p class="muted">ℹ️ If any excess fibers or roughness is on the sides of the board, light sanding with a nail file or fine sandpaper can clean it up, but this generally shouldn't be needed. It is a composite material, so be mindful of the dust if sanding.</p>

## Step 7 - Install Screen

<p class="muted">Gather: (1) Case front with color filter, buttons, slider, and lenses installed, (2) Screen Retainer, (3) Button Head Screws (2x, #2-56 x 5/32in), (4) Mainboard</p>

<p class="muted">1 - Insert the screws into the screen retainer (5)</p>

<p class="muted">2 - Carefully peel off the screen protector. Be mindful of its fragileness and fingerprints (6).</p>

<p class="muted">3 - Place the Case Front down onto a surface and guide the screen into the pocket above the color filter. The edge of the case pocket (7) is cut to perfectly fit the screen outline (8) itself and align the pixels to the screen window. It's generally easiest to start with the edge closest to the buttons, then carefully push the ribbon and screen into the case by sliding the Mainboard down into the case vertically until the screen is flat to the screen pocket.<br>⚠️ BE CAREFUL NOT TO CATCH THE CORNERS OF THE SCREEN. There is extra material cut out of the case to avoid this. Make sure the screen is inside the pocket and the corners of the screen are free from contact (9).</p>

<p class="muted">4 - While holding the Mainboard vertically with your non-dominant hand, keep the screen from moving, grab the screen retainer (with screws pre-inserted) and set into its guide pockets (10), (11).<br>⚠️ Make sure the screws ((10), (11)) and the screen retainer are seated flush. If they are not flush, the screws may contact and damage the Mainboard in the next step. Check by visually inspecting from the side for gaps and the tap test.</p>

<p class="muted">5 - Using an allen key, tighten the screen retainer screws until fully seated then add 1/16 turn (max 1/8). The retainer is designed to act as a spring; additional torque does not improve retention and can introduce unnecessary stress that may leader to long-term deformation in plastics (12). <br>⚠️ Keep a close eye on the screen to make sure it has not lifted and/or shifted while tightening down. This will break the screen if it has and you continue to tighten the screen retainer.</p>

<p class="muted">6 - Inspect to make the screen edge is aligned with the screen pocket (13). Using a similar method to the slider, lightly tap the back of the screen with your finger to see if it clicks/makes noise (13). The screen should not make any noise and be completely flat with the pocket.<br>If there is a clicking sound when tapping, first ensure there is no unintended part interference or debris, then tighten the retainer screws in small increments (~ 1/10th of a turn) until it stops clicking.<br>If the screen is not aligned to the pocket, loosen the retaining screws and shift the screen until it is aligned (using as little force as possible) and retighten the screws.</p>

<p class="muted">(16) - Example of a poorly aligned screen resting on the buttons instead of the screen pocket. This causes the screen corner to incorrectly overlap the pocket in a way that will crack.<br>(17) - Example of a well-aligned screen.<br>(18) - Example of a well-aligned screen.</p>

<p class="muted">7 - Adjust the slide potentiometer (14) and metal slider (15) to be in both bottom positions.</p>

<p class="muted">8 - Lower the Mainboard into the case. It is important to keep the Mainboard as parallel to the case as possible when lowering it in (e.g. guide it in and avoid having it enter at its naturally steep angle). This will keep the flex ribbon and slider properly aligned when tightening. <br>ℹ️ It may be a snug fit depending on how cleanly you snapped the circuit board rails off.</p>

<p class="muted">9 - While holding the Mainboard down to the Case Front with your forefingers, inspect the slider to ensure the metal fork of the slider is engaged with the plastic nub of the slide potentiometer. It will be very noticeable when it is properly engaged. Test the full range to make sure it does not pop out. <br>ℹ️ If the slider is not properly engaged, it's necessary to pull the Mainboard back up out of the case and readjust their positions (put the slider at the bottom and move the slide potentiometer near bottom if needed). <br>ℹ️ If the Mainboard is too snug to drop out with gravity, utilize a small plastic pry tool between the edge of board near the USB-C port and Front Case or very carefully prying one of the mounting holes on the Mainboard. It's important to not scratch the Mainboard with a metal tool or pry it excessively and crack the board. In the worst case, it is possible to push the board out with the buttons to try again. Be mindful of the board pulling on the screen flex cable once it is free.</p>

## Step 8 - Secure Mainboard

<p class="muted">Gather: (1) Case Front, (2) Button Head Screws (3x, #2-56 x 5/32in)</p>

<p class="muted">1 - Tighten the screws near the USB-C connector first (3), (4). They just need to be snug tight<br>2 - Then tighten the screw near the speaker (5). It may pull the Mainboard a little bit tighter in case your grip has loosened. This is okay.</p>

<p class="muted">ℹ️ If your Front Case and/or Mainboard has a hole at location (6), do NOT insert a screw here. It is not necessary.</p>

## Step 9 - Install Battery

<p class="muted">Gather: (1) Case Front, (2) Battery</p>

<p class="muted">1 - Inspect the battery connector (3) and the Mainboard battery connector (4) for orientation and wire polarity. The connector is keyed and only fits one way. Double check that + POS labeled on the Mainboard (5) will align with the red wire.</p>

<p class="muted">2 - Align the connector keys and using both index fingers and your thumbs to leverage the case, check to make sure the connectors are straight, then push the connectors together. It will be a tight fit.</p>

<p class="muted">3 - Route the wires as shown (6) and check to make sure the battery corner is not going to be pinched by the case. It is possible to lightly bend the the corner of the battery in if it is protruding excessively.</p>

<p class="muted">4 - Flip the Battery Disconnect Switch (8) to On and check that your Cyber Fidget powers up (9) and the screen looks correct.<br>ℹ️ If your Front Case and/or Mainboard has a hole at location (6), do NOT insert a screw here. It is not necessary.<br>ℹ️ If you ever want to store your Cyber Fidget long-term or avoid having it sit at full charge (e.g. when constantly plugged in), flip the power switch to off and it fully isolates the battery. Your Cyber Fidget will still power on just fine over USB-C power only.</p>

## Step 10 - Case Back Lens

<p class="muted">Gather: (1) Case Back, (2) Lens (1x, shorter)<br>Optional: The lens helps diffuse the light, but if you want to use your Cyber Fidget as a flashlight, some of the brightness will be diminished with this lens.</p>

<p class="muted">1 - Align the lens as on the Case Front and press it into the Case Back (3)</p>

## Step 11 - Install Case Back

<p class="muted">Gather: (1) Case Front, (2) Case Back, (3) Socket Head Cap Screws (4x, #6-32 x 5/8in)</p>

<p class="muted">1 - Align the Case Back to the Case Front. It's important to check this first fitment for battery clearance and wires until everything takes a set from being assembled. The two halves should have no gap and able to be cleanly aligned.<br>2 - Install the Socket Head Cap Screws. If you plan to take your Cyber Fidget apart frequently, you may finger tighten them. Otherwise, you can snug them with an allen key (4).</p>

<p class="muted">3 - Congratulations on assembly your Cyber Fidget :) (5)</p>
