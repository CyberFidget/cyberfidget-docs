They just need to be snug tight\n\n2 - Then tighten the screw near the speaker (5). It may pull the Mainboard a little bit tighter in case your grip has loosened. This is okay.\n\n\nℹ️ If your Front Case and/or Mainboard has a hole at location (6), do NOT insert a screw here. It is not necessary.",
